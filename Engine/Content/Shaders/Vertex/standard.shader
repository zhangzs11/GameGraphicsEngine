/*
	This is the standard vertex shader

	A vertex shader is responsible for two things:
		* Telling the GPU where the vertex (one of the three in a triangle) should be drawn on screen in a given window
			* The GPU will use this to decide which fragments (i.e. pixels) need to be shaded for a given triangle
		* Providing any data that a corresponding fragment shader will need
			* This data will be interpolated across the triangle and thus vary for each fragment of a triangle that gets shaded
